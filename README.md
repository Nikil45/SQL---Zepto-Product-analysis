SQL---Zepto-Product-analysis

I recently worked on a SQL project using a Zepto product dataset sourced from Kaggle. The objective of this project was to perform data cleaning, transformation, and business insight generation using SQL.

🔹 Project Workflow:
• Collected the raw dataset from Kaggle
• Created a database in SQL
• Designed and created a structured table including fields such as SKU_ID, Category, Product Name, MRP, Discount Percentage, Available Quantity, Discounted Selling Price, Weight (in grams), Out of Stock Status, and Quantity
• Imported the dataset from Excel into SQL
• Performed data validation and cleaning steps including:
Checked total row count
Identified and handled null values
Analyzed distinct product categories
Compared products in stock vs out of stock
Identified duplicate product names
Detected products where MRP or Discounted Selling Price was zero

🔹 Business Questions Solved Using SQL:
1️⃣ Identified the Top 10 Best Value Products based on Discount Percentage
2️⃣ Found products with high MRP but currently out of stock
3️⃣ Calculated estimated revenue for each product category
4️⃣ Identified products where MRP is greater than ₹500 and discount is less than 10%
5️⃣ Determined the top 5 categories offering the highest average discount
6️⃣ Calculated price per gram for products above 100g and sorted them by best value
7️⃣ Categorized products based on weight into Low, Medium, and Bulk segments
8️⃣ Calculated total inventory weight per category

This project helped me strengthen my skills in SQL, data cleaning, data transformation, and business insight generation.
